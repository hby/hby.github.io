This presentation caught my eye the other day.

[__UPDATE: The video I had linked to is no longer available so I've removed it.__ 
_The video is too old to remember specifics but my basic thoughts on Angular at the
time was that it was overly complicated at nearly every level of use.
In any case, I've never looked back after using the Reagent and
re-frame ClojureScript libraries._]

I worked on a fairly large Angular project a couple of years ago and find myself in general
agreement with the points made about Angular. I've also been playing with Reagent recently.
