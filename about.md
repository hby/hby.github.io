### [res ipsa loquitur](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Res_ipsa_loquitur)

The more I've thought about what to write here the more I'm convinced to not say anything very specific. Sure, I could
tell you about what currently interests me in the world of programming languages and software development. But I will
probably write about more than that (even though other topics have a strange way of relating back to programming).

Other than a handful of things I've had in my head for a long time, I don't have an _agenda_ for this blog. I'm
guessing that I'll return to a few themes that I think are worth thinking about. But there will be plenty of
code realted posts as well.

Eventually, there might be categories and tags that can inform (warn?) the reader as to what might be contained here.
But, for know, I'll let the sum total of the writing define what I am _About_.

Oh, I will say that the name of blog is very personal.
