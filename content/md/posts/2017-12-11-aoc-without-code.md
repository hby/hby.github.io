I've been working (_some of_) the [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com) problems since they began
just before Christmas in 2015. I've used the problems to exercise some different Clojure
muscles than the programming I do for my job. 
My solutions are on [GitHub](https://github.com/hby/advent-of-code).

When I read the problem for [part 1 of day 03](http://adventofcode.com/2017/day/3) for this year,
it struck me that you could solve this pretty quickly without writing any code. Here's the answer
sketched out on my chalkboard.

Of course, you can also write some
[code](https://github.com/hby/advent-of-code/blob/master/src/advent_of_code/2017/day03.clj)
(which helps in solving part 2).
